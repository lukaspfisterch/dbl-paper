# Related Work Mapping

**Status:** Migrated to `paper/sections/related_work.tex`

This file served as template. Final version is in LaTeX.

This file maps DBL to categories of prior work without naming specific systems. It provides a structure for later citation.

## Categories

- Constitutional or policy-based AI safety
- Guardrails and prompt filters
- Information Flow Control
- Event sourcing and audit logs
- Runtime policy enforcement and reference monitors

## Mapping Notes

For each category, record:

- Typical mechanism
- Normativity leak pattern
- What is treated as authoritative input
- DBL delta (DECISION primacy, G/L separation, V replay)

## Comparison Table (template)

| Category | Normative primitive | Observational handling | Replay or audit model | DBL delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constitutional or policy-based AI safety | | | | |
| Guardrails and prompt filters | | | | |
| Information Flow Control | | | | |
| Event sourcing and audit logs | | | | |
| Runtime policy enforcement | | | | |
