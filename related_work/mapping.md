# Related Work Mapping

This file maps DBL to categories of prior work without naming specific systems. It provides a structure for later citation.

## Categories

- Constitutional or policy-based AI safety
- Guardrails and prompt filters
- Information Flow Control
- Event sourcing and audit logs
- Runtime policy enforcement and reference monitors

## Mapping Notes

For each category, record:

- Typical mechanism
- Normativity leak pattern
- What is treated as authoritative input
- DBL delta (DECISION primacy, G/L separation, V replay)
