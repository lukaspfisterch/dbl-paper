\section{Claims}

The following claims formalize the core properties of DBL. Each claim holds under assumptions A1–A5.

\paragraph{Claim 1 (Deterministic Governance under Non-Deterministic Execution).}
For fixed authoritative inputs and fixed policy configuration, the system produces the same ordered sequence of DECISION events in V, regardless of non-deterministic execution behavior.

\paragraph{Claim 2 (Invariance of G/L Separation).}
If governance consumes only the authoritative input set admitted by L, then observational data cannot have normative effect without explicit admission, and the separation of G and L is invariant under replay, policy evolution, and effector variation.

\paragraph{Claim 3 (Replay Equivalence of Normative State).}
Replaying V from the same initial state yields the same sequence of normative states and DECISION events as the original execution.

\paragraph{Claim 4 (Observational Non-Interference).}
Observational data does not influence governance decisions; for any observational variation, governance outcomes are determined solely by the authoritative input set.
