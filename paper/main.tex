\title{Deterministic Boundary Layers: Governing Non-Deterministic Execution}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We introduce Deterministic Boundary Layers (DBL), a minimal architectural model
for governing non-deterministic systems with deterministic, auditable outcomes.
DBL separates normativity from execution by construction: all normative effects
are expressed exclusively as explicit DECISION events recorded in an append-only
event stream, while execution outputs are treated as observational and non-normative.

Governance decisions are deterministic functions of authoritative inputs admitted
by a boundary layer, independent of execution behavior, timing, or infrastructure.
This separation yields three core guarantees: deterministic governance under
non-deterministic execution, invariance of governance with respect to boundary
filtering, and replay equivalence of normative state without re-execution.

We formalize the model, state minimal axioms, and prove four claims establishing
determinism, observational non-interference, and replayability. DBL is not a policy
framework or learning method, but an architectural pattern for accountable AI
governance, auditability, and compliance in systems where execution cannot be made
deterministic.

\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Problem Context.}
Governance in non-deterministic systems requires decisions that are auditable, replayable, and accountable even when execution outcomes vary. When behavior is non-deterministic, it becomes difficult to determine whether a decision was derived from authoritative inputs or influenced by observations. This complicates reconstruction of normative state and weakens the ability to replay decisions as part of an audit record.

Non-determinism blurs the boundary between what is decided and what is observed. If execution outputs or timing signals can affect governance, accountability becomes contingent on runtime artifacts rather than explicit decision records. In such settings, replayability and auditability are not guaranteed.

\paragraph{Limitations of Existing Approaches.}
A common limitation is the entanglement of normativity with observation. Normative effects are often implicit and influenced by execution outputs or other observational data without explicit representation in a decision record. As a result, decisions are not replayable from authoritative inputs alone and accountability depends on non-replayable traces.

\paragraph{Deterministic Boundary Layers.}
Deterministic Boundary Layers (DBL) is an architectural model for governing non-deterministic execution. The central rule is that all normativity appears only as explicit DECISION events in an append-only event stream V. Governance (G) is separated from boundaries (L), with L admitting authoritative inputs and G operating only on those inputs.

Observational data, including execution outputs and other runtime artifacts, is treated as non-normative. Decisions are recorded before execution and are derived only from authoritative inputs, making normative state replayable and auditable without constraining execution outcomes.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Governance decisions are deterministic under non-deterministic execution.
  \item The separation between governance and boundaries is invariant.
  \item Normative state is replay-equivalent with respect to V.
  \item Observations do not interfere with governance decisions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Paper Organization.}
The paper introduces the architectural model and its axioms, states the four claims, provides proof sketches under fixed assumptions, and presents a single case study, followed by a related work mapping.
